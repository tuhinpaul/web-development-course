## Conference call (Zoom/GoogleMeet/MicrosoftTeams)

If no particular software is recommended by the admins/moderators of Hindu Economic Forum, will post
the link of meeting here at least **5 minutes** before the meet. **Please note that** free versions
of these meeting applications have time limits and, therefore, there may be two links. When the first
expires, I'd start conference on the seconde link.

## Meeting time
